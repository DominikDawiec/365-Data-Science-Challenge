# 365 Data Science Challenge

This repository hosts the resources for the **365 Data Science Challenge**, featuring my analysis of student engagement within a data science course platform. Key aspects of the project encompass **data cleansing, visual representation of data, and construction of predictive models**. Data utilized in the analysis is located in the [data_files](data_files) directory, while the analytical code is accessible in the [notebook.ipynb](notebook.ipynb) file.
