# 365 Data Science Challenge

This repository contains the code and data documentation for the 365 Data Science Challenge, where I have analyzed student engagement on a data science course site. The project includes data cleaning, data visualization, and model building. The data files can be found in the [data_files](data_files) directory and the code in the [notebook.ipynb](notebook.ipynb) file.

#### Project Status: [Completed]

## Getting Started
To run this project on your local machine, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook and the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install the required libraries by running pip install -r requirements.txt in your terminal. Once you have the necessary dependencies, you can open the notebook file and run the code cells.
